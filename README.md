# Lins-POS

A restaurant web-based POS system developed with React, Bootstrap, and Axios.

You can access the Lins-POS web-based POS system at [https://linspos.web.app](https://linspos.web.app).

This application allows users to create new orders and manage their settings through a web-based interface. Upon submitting an order, the data is sent to a Node.js backend server via TCP and then printed through a thermal printer.
